MHF - Multi Hash Function
 by @shoghicp
 
Based on RC4 (and deleting some of their weakness),
this stream cipher allows any key size, and the first
portion of the keystream is discarded.
An optional nonce can be added to the input of the algorithm.
Also allows to create hashes of arbitrary lenght (but lenght
must be divisible by 2)
